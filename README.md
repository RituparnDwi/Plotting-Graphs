# Plotting-Graphs
# Data visulization helps us to see how data look like and the kind of correlation that exist between the attributes of data.
# It also helps to understand how the features correspond to the output.
# We can either organize data in the form of tables or present it pictorially using bar charts, histogram, frequency plots, scatter plots, box plots etc.
# Histogram, Density plot and box plot are used for drawing univariate plots, correlation plots.
# A Univariate plots help us to visulize a single-variable and understand each attributes of our dataset independently.
